**This repo includes the structure and setup of an original computerized game. The full description and instructions for the game are provided, as well as its software implementation.**
### The Game
In this deceptively simple game of solitary play, memories are tested and visual analysis muscles are flexed. The user is presented with a grid of white buttons which each adopt a different color (5 being black) for a few seconds before turning back to white. The user tries to select the previously black buttons and receives points for correct selections.

***The full spec for the game is included in the repo.***
